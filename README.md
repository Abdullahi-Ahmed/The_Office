DBT (Data Build Tool) is an open-source tool used for managing and orchestrating SQL-based data transformation workflows. It allows users to write modular, well-tested SQL code and build data pipelines that are version-controlled, maintainable, and scalable.To obtain further details, refer to the blog post available at [Is dbt the right tool for my data transformations?](https://www.getdbt.com/blog/is-dbt-the-right-tool-for-my-data-transformations/).  
  
This repository contains source code intended for on-demand learning of DBT, a tool used for managing SQL-based data transformation workflows.

## Models
dbt models are SQL-based queries that transform raw data into analytics-ready tables. Models are the core building blocks of DBT projects and provide a modular, organized way to transform data. One key advantage of using models in DBT is that they are version-controlled, allowing users to track changes and collaborate effectively.

|:---------|
| You can review the naming conventions, structure, and code of basic dbt models, [here](https://github.com/Abdullahi-Ahmed/The_Office/tree/main/models). |  

Simple dbt model `Stg_Customers.sql`:
